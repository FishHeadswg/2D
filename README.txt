2D Game

Description:

	A single level of a standard 2D platformer game. Implements 2D sprites, 
	2D sprite animations with blend trees, player controls and patrolling 
	enemies. Outside sources for sprites and audio are:
	
	GNU / Linux character sprites - http://opengameart.org/content/2d-platformer-slide-scroller-unsorted (Refais23)
	Environmental sprites - http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated (Kenney) *
	BGM & other SFX - http://opengameart.org/content/oves-essential-game-audio-pack-collection-160-files-updated (OveMelaa)
	Jump SFX - http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-jumping-sounds (dklon)
	* The alpha channels had to be manually fixed in PS for these sprites to resolve transparency issues.
